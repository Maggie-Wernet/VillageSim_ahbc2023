This is a grid-based village simulation game built using React. In this game, players can create and manage their own virtual village on a grid-based map, making strategic decisions to ensure the prosperity and well-being of their villagers.

## Features

- **Grid-based Map**: Manage your village on a grid-based map, where each cell has the potential to house a new improvement to your village. Plan on trading resources to make vital improvements to ensure village growth.

- **Resource Management**: Allocate your resources correctly to be able to maintain a balance between resource consumption and production to sustain your village's growth.

- **Building Construction**: Construct various types of improvements on the grid, each serving a unique purpose and providing specific benefits. Build houses for villager, fields for food production, pastures for animals, lumber mills for resources extraction and wells to water villagers, fields, and animals.

- **Progression and Achievements**: Earn achievements and unlock rewards as you progress and achieve milestones in the game. Challenge yourself to maximize the development and prosperity of your village.
